This code implements and evaluates algorithms for the paper [Hindsight Learning for MDPs with Exogenous Inputs
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06272). In this paper we introduce Hindsight Learning, an algorithm to learn efficiently in a sub-class of MDPs coined MDPs with Exogenous Inputs.

## Repository Overview

The code is subdivided into three folders for the three different experiments conducted, including:
- Online Bin Packing (OBP)
- Airline Revenue Management (ARM)
- Multi Secretary (MS)

The Virtual Machine (VM) Allocation code is proprietary and thus is not included in the supplementary materials.
